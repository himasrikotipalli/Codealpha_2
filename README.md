# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices. The dataset used contains historical stock price data of a specific company, aiming to predict future stock prices based on past trends.

## Dataset Information

The dataset comprises the following columns:

- `Date`: Date of the stock price record.
- `Open`: Opening price of the stock.
- `High`: Maximum price of the stock during the day.
- `Low`: Minimum price of the stock during the day.
- `Close`: Closing price of the stock.
- `Volume`: Volume of stocks traded.
- `Adj Close`: Adjusted closing price, considering stock splits, dividends, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stock-price-prediction`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned above.
3. Download the stock price dataset (e.g., `stock_data.csv`) and place it in the project directory.
4. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook for stock price prediction.
5. Follow the code and comments to comprehend data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Files

- `stock_data.csv`: Dataset with historical stock prices.
- `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed for this project.

## Approach

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for model training.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze historical stock prices, visualize trends, and identify patterns.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features like moving averages, technical indicators, etc., for improved prediction.
4. Model Training: Construct an LSTM model using TensorFlow or PyTorch and train it on the historical stock price data.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

- The trained model achieves a certain accuracy score (e.g., R-squared value or MSE) on the test dataset.
- Visualizations display the predicted stock prices compared to actual prices, showcasing the model's performance.
